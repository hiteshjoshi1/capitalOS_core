# Issue 115: Stocks page: move Sync now next to the stock table

Issue: https://github.com/hiteshjoshi1/capitalOS_core/issues/115

## Objective
- The Stocks page's refresh button ("Refresh quotes") sits with the holdings table it refreshes, not in the page header.

## Architecture Decisions
- Same button and handler, moved into the Top Holdings section header next to Columns; that row now wraps on narrow screens.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Button in the Top Holdings header on desktop and at 375px; behaviour unchanged.

## How To Test
- `npx vitest run src/__tests__/StockHoldings.test.tsx`; screenshot `/holdings` at 1440px and 375px.
